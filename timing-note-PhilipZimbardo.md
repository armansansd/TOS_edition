##The secret power of time
Tim Zimbardo  
RSA conference - 24 mai 2010

Il y a 6 zone temporel importante, dans lesquels les personnes vivent :  
* 2 focus on the past
* 2 on the present
* 2 on the futur

Ceux concentrés sur le passé se souviennent des jours heureux, des anniversaires, "the good old time", d'autres ne font que regreté le temps perdu.  

past 	| positiv / negativ |
 	 good memories / regrets
present | positiv / negativ |
	 hedonistic / my life is faded
futur	| positiv / negativ |
	work rather then play / life begin after death

who have to trust the futur to be futur oriented, also the climat influence your behavior. The closer you are from equator the more present oriented you are. Because there is no season, less change in your environment.  

**TIME PERSPECTIVE** 

*The Geography of time* by Robert Levine

The pace of life  : time perspective is how pepople devided there own experience into time-zone.  we also have different sens of duration (poser la main sur une plaque chauffante / s'assoir à coté d'une jolie fille)   
Sens of Duration is link to wether we were bored /excited or not  
In different culture people has a different pace of life, the experience is very simple, you sit in a caffé you draw a line  of 100m and you calculate how fast people walk . 

####technology and kids

>We are under-estimating the power of technology in re-wiring young peoples brains. 

 
there is a new graduation of life, we now live with the second as a scale, not the hour or anything else.   
What matter people now is how long it takes to boot up your computer, and how long it takes to download something. Even if this is less then a minute, that makes people angry.Waiting becomming a waste of time.

We have to understand our own time persepectiv and thats of other.
