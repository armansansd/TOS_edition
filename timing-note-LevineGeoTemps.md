##Geography of Time

Robert Levine

>The pace of life is a matter of tempo.  
Psychologist
Robert Ornstein calls instances like these, where people are able
to experience action as if it were occurring in the infinite present,
as living “in-time.”
Contemporary Western athletes speak in their own Zen-like
terms about time expansion. Tennis great Jimmy Connors has de-
scribed transcendent occasions when his game rose to a level
where he felt he’d entered a “zone"

Déformation de la perception du passage du temps  

>There are at least five major factors that influence the experience
of duration.  

* Pleasantness
* Degree of Urgency
* The Amount of Activity
* Variety
* Time-Free Tasks

>Robert Ornstein believes that the perception of du-
ration is determined by how much we experience and remember
of a situation. A successful experience, he argues, is better orga-
nized in memory than a failure. Better organized memory pack-
ages result in smaller storage sizes, which are perceived as shorter
in duration.

>Meade took advan-
tage of the fact that time is experienced as shorter when people
believe that they are making progress toward a goal.

>We live in a culture where it is not uncom-
mon for people to literally run in order to relax, or to pay money
for the privilege of pacing on a treadmill. It sometimes seems as if
life is constructed with the primary goal of avoiding the awkward-
ness and sometimes the terror of having nothing to do.

time is a stretch of nerve fibers: seemingly continu-
ous from a distance but disjointed close up, with mi-
croscopic gaps between fibers. Nervous action flows
through one segment of time, abruptly stops, pauses,
leaps through a vacuum, and resumes in the neigh-
boring segment.
ALAN LIGHTMAN, Einstein’s Dream

>There is an ever-changing texture to time.

The new physics describes the movement of physical time as
“bumpy.” Bumps in space—in space-time, strictly speaking—result
from the dynamics of gravitational attraction. The same might be
said for the psychological experience of duration in social time.
Unlike the apparently unvarying movement of the time on the
clock, the flow of psychological time is bumpier at some times and
more evenly fluid at others. 50

>Long ago, before the Great Clock, time was mea-
sured by changes in heavenly bodies: the slow sweep
of stars across the night sky, the arc of the sun and
variation in light, the waxing and waning of the
moon, tides, seasons. Time was measured also by
heartbeats, the rhythms of drowsiness and sleep, the
recurrence of hunger, the menstrual cycles of
women, the duration of loneliness.
